Give me an example of some Golem files that will perform code review on a code base with multiple components.Examples:


default:
  dependencies:
    - transactions
    - components


software_overview:
  dependencies:
    - !node_modules
  prompt: >
    Software design is comprised of components, interfaces and transactions.
    Talk about how all of these pieces are designed, and fit together.  Use code
    snippet examples with filenames, line numbers. Draw Mermaid.JS diagrams.

transactions:
  dependencies:
    - software_overview
  prompt: >
      Generate the names, descriptions and sequence diagrams of the major
      transactions that flow through this application.  Use code snippet examples
      with filenames, line numbers.  Draw Mermaid.JS diagrams."


components:
  dependencies:
    - software_overview
  prompt: >
    Generate the names, descriptions and diagrams of the major
    components of this system.  Use code snippet examples file
    filenames, line numbers.  Draw Mermaid.JS diagrams.

Redo the examples.
