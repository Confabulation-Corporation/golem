I want to write an AI build system. It allows you to build (and maybe run!) things with AI. The main way it works is through a system called Golem. Golem files are something like Makefiles. A few key differences: The first line of a Beholder defines its dependencies. These dependencies can be files, directories, local Golem targets, or Golem targets that are in other directories. Example Golem file:

default:
  dependencies:
    - transactions
    - components


software_overview:
  dependencies:
    - !node_modules
  prompt: >
    Software design is comprised of components, interfaces and transactions.
    Talk about how all of these pieces are designed, and fit together.  Use code
    snippet examples with filenames, line numbers. Draw Mermaid.JS diagrams.

transactions:
  dependencies:
    - software_overview
  prompt: >
      Generate the names, descriptions and sequence diagrams of the major
      transactions that flow through this application.  Use code snippet examples
      with filenames, line numbers.  Draw Mermaid.JS diagrams."


components:
  dependencies:
    - software_overview
  prompt: >
    Generate the names, descriptions and diagrams of the major
    components of this system.  Use code snippet examples file
    filenames, line numbers.  Draw Mermaid.JS diagrams.
